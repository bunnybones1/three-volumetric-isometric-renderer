# three-fauxel-tiles
A experiment to render a 3D voxel world in a faux PBR pixel-art isometric style


# Approach and History #
This is an attempt to combine these ideas:
- isometric rendering of 3D voxel world, as a series of 2D triangles
- Deferred rendering (PBR)
- Just-in-time model prerendering into atlases
- making adjacency rules to control/generate tiles with correct transitions to their neighbors
